    "In the mystical kingdom of Luminaris lies the fortress known as the Gates of Light, guarding treasures of immense power. Protected by an enchantment, the fortress has **G** magical gates, each bound by powerful spells. **L** mystical levers are the keys to unlocking these gates. Each lever can toggle the state of certain gates, and their effects are charted on a mystical map represented by a **LxG** matrix. Only the right combination of lever activations can open all the gates and reveal the treasures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the matrix, the rows represent the leavers, while the columns correspond to the magical gates. The value at position **(i, j)** in the matrix is 1 if leaver **i** affects gate **j**, causing it to change state, and 0 if it does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance if we have 2 leavers and 3 gates, then activations can be respresentate as:\n",
    "[[0, 1, 1],\n",
    "[1, 0, 0]]\n",
    "\n",
    "If the states of the doors are (open, closed, open) and we use the first leaver then the state of the first door will remain the same, while the other two doors will change their states: (open, open, closed).\n",

    "#### Question 1: Compare the performance of the BFS and UCS algotihms. Is there anything that surprised you? (max 150 words)\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Uniform Cost Search (UCS) is quite similar in this scenario, with both algorithms finding the optimal solution with a cost of 7. Each explored 79,212 nodes and reached a maximum frontier length of 181,441, but both timed out due to extensive time requirements that are 383.20 seconds for BFS and 393.67 seconds for UCS. This outcome is expected since UCS behaves like BFS when all path costs are uniform, as in this Gate of Light problem. The slight difference in timing is odd, as UCS is typically expected to be quicker, or at least identical in performance when all arc costs are the same. One possible explanation could be associated with UCS's use of a priority queue, which may involve extra library invocations and the overhead in handling costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 2: Summarise the performance of the Informed Search Startegies. Is it what you expected? (max 300 words)\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of three informed search strategies, Greedy Search, A* Search, and IDA* Search varies significantly in their generated statistic, but it is as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Greedy Search is the fastest, taking only 0.004593 seconds to find a solution with a cost of 13, exploring 81 nodes, and having a maximum frontier length of 544. This speed comes from prioritizing nodes closest to the goal based on the heuristic. However, it doesn’t guarantee finding the least-cost path because it ignores the actual cost of the path, leading to a suboptimal solution, as reflected by the higher cost compared to A* and IDA* searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "A* Search took 3.497990 seconds, finding an optimal solution with a cost of 7, exploring 5572 nodes, and with a maximum frontier length of 18,797. A* Search balances the heuristic with the actual path cost from the start node, ensuring an optimal solution but requiring more time and memory, as indicated by the larger frontier and longer computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "IDA* Search, the slowest at 5.703394 seconds, also found an optimal solution with a cost of 7, exploring 182,470 nodes but with a much smaller maximum frontier length of 41. This is expected since IDA* is more memory-efficient, using depth-first search approach with iterative deepening, where the depth is controlled by a heuristic. The smaller frontier reflects its memory efficiency, but the need to re-explore paths due to the iterative deepening approach results in a larger number of explored nodes and longer time, showcasing the trade-off between memory usage and speed.\n"

    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Breadth-First Search (BFS) has drastic difference in performance is due to Task 5’s larger state space and uniform costs, which resulted in massive exploration and led to timed out. Task 6’s Graph problem with simpler structure and less state space allowed BFS to quickly explore fewer nodes and solve the problem efficiently, and surprisingly for both tasks, BFS were able to find optimal result even when arcs' cost are different in Task 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform Cost Search (UCS) similar to BFS, UCS in Task 5 had to explore a vast number of nodes due to the uniform cost structure, leading to a timeout. Task 6’s smaller graph with varied arc costs allowed UCS to perform efficiently indicated by less nodes explored (time is extremely similar, yet longer, might due to the same reason mentioned Task 5 Q1 again), demonstrating its typical advantage of UCS relative to BFS when path costs differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Greedy Search performs consistently fast in both tasks, but its suboptimality is more evident in Task 5, where the higher cost indicates a less efficient path. Task 6’s simpler problem structure led to quicker and an optimal result.\n",
    "\n",
    "A* consistently finds optimal solutions but is more computationally expensive relative Greedy Search same as in the task 5. Task 5’s larger state space and uniform costs increased the exploration required. Task 6’s smaller graph allowed A* to perform more efficiently, though still slower than Greedy Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "IDA* is slower than other search methods in both tasks due to its iterative deepening approach, which requires re-exploration of nodes from beginning each time went back from outer while loop when threshold needed to change. Task 5’s large state space amplified this issue, leading to high explored nodes count, whereas Task 6’s smaller problem allowed quicker, though still less efficient compared to other algorithms."
